**Handling Async Operations with Redis:**
   - Understand and deal with asynchronous operations when interacting with Redis. Promises or callback functions might be involved in managing asynchronous code.

6. **Using Kue as a Queue System:**
   - Implement a queue system using Kue, which is a priority job queue for Node.js backed by Redis. Learn how to enqueue, dequeue, and process jobs asynchronously.

7. **Building a Basic Express App Interacting with Redis:**
   - Create a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server. This could involve storing and retriIt looks like you're working on a project related to building a queuing system in JavaScript using Redis, Kue, and Express. Here's a brief overview of the learning objectives mentioned:

1. **Running a Redis Server:**
   - Install and run a Redis server on your local machine. You might use tools like `redis-server` or Docker to set up and start the Redis server.

2. **Simple Operations with Redis Client:**
   - Understand and perform basic operations using a Redis client. This includes commands like `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, etc.

3. **Using Redis Client with Node.js:**
   - Integrate a Redis client library with Node.js. Popular libraries include `ioredis` or `node-redis`. Learn how to connect to a Redis server and perform operations within a Node.js environment.

4. **Storing Hash Values in Redis:**
   - Explore how to store and retrieve hash values using Redis. Hashes are useful for representing objects or records with multiple fields.

5. eving data, using Redis as a caching layer, etc.

8. **Building a Basic Express App with Redis and Queue:**
   - Extend the Express application to incorporate the queuing system (Kue). This involves setting up routes or endpoints that enqueue jobs and handling the asynchronous processing of those jobs.

Throughout the project, make sure to understand the interactions between Redis, Node.js, and the queuing system. Implementing these steps will give you practical experience in building a simple queuing system with Redis in a Node.js environment using Kue and Express.
